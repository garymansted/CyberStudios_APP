</p>

**CyberStudios** was initally created for the registration and control of custom IoT devices. The IoT devices were capable of real-time, two-way data transmission via WiFi or celular connection. Firstly the device is registered (added to the users account), assigned to one of the formention connections and given a name for quick reference. Once registered the user could control their devices' via the main interface - switching on and off, setting device pararameters (delays ect) along with monitoring incomming data.<br/>
The app was tested by staff and clients within the hotel industry. Clients were able to set certain alerts that alerted service staff to their requirements/ needs - greatly reducing service times and daily opperation running costs. Staff recevied remote (push) notifications for their communication efficiency. The alerts included a *'Make up my Room'* alert, a *'Do Not Disturb'* alert, and a *''* alert. Service staff were able to dismiss the notifications (alerts) on the device itself - sending requests to the main server that were received by the account holder.<br/><br/>
The app was beta tested through [TestFlight](https://testflight.apple.com/) to make sure it was bug free before release.
